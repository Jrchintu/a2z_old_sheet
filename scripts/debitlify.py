# --- Python Bit.ly Link Replacer ---
# This script reads a file, finds all unique bit.ly links,
# expands them to their final destination URL, and then replaces
# them in the original content, saving the result to a new file.

# --- USAGE ---
#   python expand_and_replace.py <input_file_path>
#
#   Example:
#   python expand_and_replace.py a2z.json
#
#   This will create a new file named 'a2z_expanded.json'.
