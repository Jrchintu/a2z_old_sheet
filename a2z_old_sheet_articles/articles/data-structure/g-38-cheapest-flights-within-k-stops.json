Now, one must wonder that based on what parameter we should add elements to the priority queue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, if we store the elements in the priority queue with the priority given to the minimum distance first, then after a few iterations we would realize that the Algorithm will halt when the number of stops would exceed. This may result in a wrong answer as it would not allow us to explore those paths which have more cost but fewer stops than the current answer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To tackle this issue, we store the elements in terms of the minimum number of <strong>stops </strong>in the priority queue so that when the algorithm halts, we can get the minimum cost within limits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, a point to note here is that do we really need a priority queue for carrying out the algorithm? The answer for that is <strong>No</strong> because when we are storing everything in terms of a number of stops, the stops are increasing monotonically which means that the number of sops is increasing by 1 and when we pop an element out of the queue, we are always popping the element with a lesser number of stops first. Replacing the priority queue with a simple queue will let us eliminate an extra log(N) of the complexity of insertion-deletion in a priority queue which would in turn make our algorithm a lot faster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Initial configuration:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Queue: </strong>Define a Queue that would contain pairs of the type {stops, {node,dist} }, where \u2018dist\u2019 indicates the currently updated value of the distance from the source to the \u2018node\u2019 and \u2018stops\u2019 contains the number of nodes one has to traverse in order to reach node from src.</li><li><strong>Distance Array: </strong>Define a distance array that would contain the minimum cost/distance from the source cell to a particular cell. If a cell is marked as \u2018infinity\u2019 then it is treated as unreachable/unvisited.</li><li><strong>Source and Destination: </strong>Define the source and the destination from where the flights have to run.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Algorithm consists of the following steps :</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Start by creating an adjacency list, a queue that stores the distance-node and stops pairs in the form {stops,{node,dist}} and a dist array with each node initialized with a very large number ( to indicate that they\u2019re unvisited initially) and the source node marked as \u20180\u2019.</li><li>We push the source cell to the queue along with its distance which is also 0 and the stops are marked as \u20180\u2019 initially because we\u2019ve just started.</li><li>Pop the element at the front of the queue and look out for its adjacent nodes.&nbsp;</li><li>If the current dist value of a node is better than the previous distance indicated by the distance array and the number of stops until now is less than K, we update the distance in the array and push it to the queue. Also, increase the stop count by 1.</li><li>We repeat the above three steps until the queue becomes empty. Note that we <strong>do not</strong> stop the algorithm from just reaching the destination node as it may give incorrect results.</li><li>Return the calculated distance/cost after we reach the required number of stops. If the queue becomes empty and we don\u2019t encounter the destination node, return \u2018-1\u2019 indicating there\u2019s no path from source to destination.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick demonstration of the Algorithm\u2019s 1st iteration for <strong>example 1</strong> stated above ( all the further iterations would be done in a similar way ) :</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7203,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://static.takeuforward.org/wp/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-08-144144.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7203\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Note: If you wish to see the dry run of the above approach, you can watch the video attached to this article.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n    <div class=\"code-section secondary-details\">\n    <div class=\"code-tabs\">\n    <button class=\"code-tab dsa_article_code_active\" data-lang=\"cpp\">C++</button>\n    <button class=\"code-tab\" data-lang=\"java\">Java</button>\n    \n    \n    <svg width=\"17\" class=\"copy-btn\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 17 20\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n    <path d=\"M2 20C1.45 20 0.979002 19.804 0.587002 19.412C0.195002 19.02 -0.000664969 18.5493 1.69779e-06 18V4H2V18H13V20H2ZM6 16C5.45 16 4.979 15.804 4.587 15.412C4.195 15.02 3.99934 14.5493 4 14V2C4 1.45 4.196 0.979002 4.588 0.587002C4.98 0.195002 5.45067 -0.000664969 6 1.69779e-06H15C15.55 1.69779e-06 16.021 0.196002 16.413 0.588002C16.805 0.980002 17.0007 1.45067 17 2V14C17 14.55 16.804 15.021 16.412 15.413C16.02 15.805 15.5493 16.0007 15 16H6ZM6 14H15V2H6V14Z\">\n    </path>\n    </svg>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"code-content\">\n    <div class=\"code-block dsa_article_code_active\" data-lang=\"cpp\">\n    \n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code lang=\"cpp\" class=\"language-cpp\">#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Solution\n{\npublic:\n    int CheapestFLight(int n, vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;
